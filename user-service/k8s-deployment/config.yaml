# Deploy configuration (replacement for simple .env file) services.
# While not sensitive stuff can be deployed in a simple `ConfigMap`,
# things like passwords and usernames should be deployed through secrets.
#
# Note: even when using `Secret`, it is not a good practice to place
# the base64 encoded value directly in this file! We have made this
# for the sake of simplicity of this assignment.
